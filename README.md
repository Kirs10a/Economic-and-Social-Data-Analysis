# Economic-and-Social-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes multiple datasets, including gender wage gaps, ice cream sales, CO₂ emissions, and housing data from Ames, Iowa. The analyses explore social, economic, environmental, and real estate trends, offering insights into patterns and correlations within each dataset.
Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to interpret and visualize data from different fields, answering key questions and uncovering trends. The analyses cover:

Gender wage gap in various countries
Seasonal ice cream sales
Relationship between CO₂ emissions and GDP per capita
Ames Housing data, focusing on property characteristics like sale price, garage size, living area, and build year
Key Analyses:
Gender Wage Gap (2015)

Comparison of gender wage gaps across OECD countries.
Identification of countries with the highest and lowest gender wage gaps.
Ice Cream Sales (May 2019 to March 2020)

Analysis of seasonal sales trends and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on ice cream sales.
CO₂ Emissions and GDP per Capita

Exploration of the relationship between CO₂ emissions per capita and GDP per capita across countries, with population size as an influencing factor.
Ames Housing Data Analysis

Analysis of the Ames Housing dataset, covering property sales between 2006 and 2010.
Scatterplot matrix exploring relationships between variables like sale price, year built, garage size, and living area size.
Dataset Descriptions
Gender Wage Gap: OECD data on the gender wage gap across countries in 2015.
Ice Cream Sales: Sales data from May 2019 to March 2020, highlighting seasonal patterns.
CO₂ Emissions and GDP: Data on CO₂ emissions and GDP per capita, with bubble sizes representing population.
Ames Housing Data: Housing data from Ames, Iowa, including sale price, garage size, living area size, and year built.

Analysis Details
1. Gender Wage Gap Analysis (2015)
This section presents an analysis of gender wage gaps across 30 countries based on OECD data.

2. Ice Cream Sales Trend (May 2019 to March 2020)
Focuses on analyzing sales patterns and identifying anomalies, particularly around the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. CO₂ Emissions vs. GDP per Capita
Examines the relationship between CO₂ emissions per capita and GDP per capita with population size as an additional factor.

4. Ames Housing Data Analysis
This analysis explores the Ames Housing dataset from 2006-2010, examining property characteristics and trends.

Scatterplot Matrix: A scatterplot matrix visualizes the relationships between sale price, size of the garage, size of the living area, and year built.
Questions Addressed:
What do the diagonal graphs in the scatterplot represent?
Are most garages in Ames larger or smaller than 1000 ft²?
Are the most expensive houses built before or after 1950?
Describe the relationship between "Size of Living Area" and "Sale Price."
